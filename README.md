PERSONA.....(i put too much effort of 1hr in this so dont judge me)üòÅ


their are no changes in public folder i just deleted logo default images of react and doesnt change manifest which is causing some error in my code but still itsworking.
bugs known :
1. not optimized for every screen type due to lack of css capabilities and code is written in css rather than using bootstrap.
2. shows just nav on opening the site actually thats something occured when i deploy build doesnt happen in development mode.
3. on hovering education list in mobile mode container for hover effect is small. 
4. and sorry for spell mistakes.
